# CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing, security scanning, and deployment.

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline Overview

### Continuous Integration (CI)

- Runs on every push to `main` and `develop` branches
- Executes tests, linting, and security checks
- Builds and tests Docker images
- Generates code coverage reports

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

- **Development**: Auto-deploys on push to `develop` branch
- **Production**: Deploys on tag push (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
